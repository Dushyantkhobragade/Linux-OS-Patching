# OS Patching for Fedora based Linux OS
# Note: It is solely experimental playbook. Be cautious before implementing in Production.

1. Create Inventory file with required groups to target specific client machine
2. Review Patching yaml playbook and update wherever needed based on the enviroment or requirement.

From Ansible master server, I am using root to execute it.

# ansible-playbook OS_Patching.yaml -i <<Inventory_file>>
